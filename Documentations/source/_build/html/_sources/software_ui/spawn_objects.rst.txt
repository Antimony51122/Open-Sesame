Objects Spawn & Their Properties
================================

Objects Spawn
-------------

The object spawn action has been conducted in two scripts in parallel:

* ``SpawnManager.cs`` (which takes charge of all items spawn in the sea)
* ``SpawnSeaGullManager.cs`` (which only takes charge of spawning seagull)

The two classes have no interactions and effect on each other and working simulataniously.
